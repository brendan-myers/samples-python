# 1_BasicBedrockWorkflow
A basic Bedrock workflow. Starts a workflow with a prompt, generates a response and ends the workflow.

1. Run the worker: `python run_worker.py`
2. In another terminal run the client with a prompt:

    e.g. `python send_message.py 'What animals are marsupials?'`

3. View the worker's output for the response.
